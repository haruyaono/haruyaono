I enjoy taking ideas from concept to working products—
especially when they streamline workflows or create real business value.

I work across backend, frontend, infrastructure, and AI where needed,
handling everything from design and implementation to deployment and ongoing improvement.
I care not just about “building something” but about getting it to the point where it truly delivers value.

I love collaborating with teams to turn
“Wouldn’t it be better if…?” into something real.
Feel free to reach out—always happy to build something together.
